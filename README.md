mysql -u root -p<password> < server/db/schema.sql
```
Password is defined in [server/db/index.js](server/db/index.js) (default is: 1214).

nodemon server/server.js

and navigate to [localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Webpack development notes:
- Start with ``webpack -w`` to continue watching files. Use ``webpack -p`` to minify for production version. NB: occasionally ``webpack -w`` won't hear latest changes. Restart it occasionally/if your bug seems weird.
